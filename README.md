# ENSE374-HabitTrackerApp-Project
Kaizen Habit tracker application 

**Project background/Business Opportunity
We believe that everyone has the potential to become a better version of themselves by reflecting on their good and bad habits and using said habits as a stepping stone to work toward improving one's lifestyle through the use of our web application. As many people know from experience, setting goals and sticking to them is a difficult task to maintain. We've all been through the classic January 1st tradition of "This year, I am going to go to the gym every day, read 15 books, get my diet in check..." but by the time February rolls around, we have already gone back to our old ways of junk food and video games. The simple fact is people want to improve their habits, however big or small they may be as it can lead to positive physical, mental, and spiritual benefits. Team Crusher's habit/goal tracking app is designed to be the support system many people need in order to stick with their goals and incorporate new adjustments into their life. The application will feature a simple, easy-to-use interface that allows the user to input their goals/habits and set timelines for any subgoals they may have. By creating a visual representation of how far someone has come since they started, it encourages them to stay on track as well as hold them accountable for any slip-ups they may have.**
